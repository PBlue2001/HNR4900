# My Mission
My Mission as a student of life is not only to understand the world around me but enhance it. Through my work in the networking and cyber fields, I have learned connections are key both in the real and digital world. Being able to connect with others all around the globe and come together as one for the good of society is something I strive to create and maintain.
