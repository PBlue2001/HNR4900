# Physical Final, fire simulation
This was my final for computational physics. It is a simulation of fire spreading in a forest. It simulated firefighters most efficient paths to the largest group of fire, demonstrating real life applicability. You can compile/run it for yourself if you download the ipynb file and open it on google drive.
