# Physical Final, fire simulation
This was my final for computational physics. It is a simulation of fire spreading in a forest. It simulated firefighters most efficient paths to the largest group of fire, demonstrating real life applicability. You can compile/run it for yourself following this guide to ipynb files: https://www.adobe.com/uk/acrobat/resources/document-files/text-files/ipynb.html
