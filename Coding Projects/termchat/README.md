# Termchat
By far the largest project on this github, this fully IRC compliant code has to be zipped to fit on here, but demonstrates the nearly semester long project to increase communication capabilities on this campus. It is a terminal based chat system, allowing any two computers connected to the campus network to communicate over a shared port and socket.
